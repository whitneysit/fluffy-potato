# Hi, there :)
## welcome to fluffy potato

This repo is a living repo to share my on-going work in learning front-end and full-stack development and tools. 

I have five years of software developement experience but little in front-end. My goal in the coming weeks is to build end-to-end applications and deploy them to live. 

If you come across this repo and you have any questions or feedback or just want to say hi, feel free to connect via my LinkedIn --> [https://www.linkedin.com/in/whitney-sit/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/whitney-sit/) .

Happy Coding!
